    heading: "What is web hosting?",
    text: `Web hosting is a service that allows you to store your website’s files on a server, making it accessible to everyone online. Shared hosting is one of the numerous available types of hosting – it employs shared server resources. The more successful a website becomes, the more resources it will require to run smoothly.

        Hostinger allows you to upgrade your hosting package as needed, so you may start with a basic Shared web hosting plan and switch to a cloud or VPS hosting plan later.
        
        Most common types of hosting include:
        
        Shared hosting: it involves a number of websites hosted on the same server, with each user receiving a certain amount of storage and resources. Shared solutions are frequently the best option for beginners and bloggers because it is the most cost-effective.
        
        VPS hosting: a virtual private server (VPS) is the next level of hosting. It employs more powerful hardware that simulates virtual server instances on the same gear.
        
        Cloud hosting: it may be ideal for you if you want additional server processing power. As cloud hosting employs many interconnected servers that take over from one another if necessary, you can count on your website to be up and running at all times.
        
        Dedicated hosting: it provides you with a server that is dedicated to your website only without sharing storage or resources with anybody else. Professional web administrators and developers are typically advised to purchase dedicated hosting.
        
        Our primary goal at Hostinger is to provide a mix of cloud and shared website hosting to our customers. As a result, we can provide our customers fast hosting with premium features and virtually 100% uptime at an unbelievable price.`,

    heading: `How does a web hosting service work?`,
    text: `Your website is a collection of files and databases that users see as they navigate it. Hostinger, like most web providers, provides the resources for you to store this information and make it accessible.

    When you sign up for Hostinger's managed hosting plan, you'll receive login information for the admin panel of your account. From it, you’ll be able to control your website, its hosting, domain, databases, files, and more.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `Why do I need a website host?`,
    text: `You need a hosting package to get your website up and operating and visible to everyone else.

    While it is possible to create a website without third-party hosting, this is not advised for beginners. If you don't know how to set up a hosting server, you'll save time and money by letting Hostinger handle the heavy work`,
  },
  {
    heading: `What kind of support will I get?`,
    text: `Our Customer Success team goes above and beyond to guarantee that our clients succeed online. So, if you have an issue, go ahead and contact us! We'll do everything to resolve it and guide you forward.

    Our customer success team is well regarded in the industry, and we have a long history of going above and beyond to assist our clients. We answer fast and completely, and we don't stop until a solution is discovered.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `What are the differences between web hosting services and domains?`,
    text: `When you enter in a URL (for example, http://www.hostinger.com), your web browser queries that domain name (for example, hostinger.com) and inquires about the website's hosting location. The items that are saved there are then loaded by the browser.

    A domain name and web hosting are required for any website so it could be accessible online. Consider the domain name the address and the hosting as the actual structure`,
  },
  {
    heading: `What are the main differences between shared hosting and VPS?`,
    text: `A virtual private server (VPS) is a hybrid of shared hosting and dedicated server technology. Some people equate VPS hosting to living in an apartment building, while others compare it to renting a condo.

    You share a server and its resources with a number of other websites when you use shared hosting. You're still sharing certain resources with a VPS, but its software is set up so that a single system serves as numerous dedicated servers, with each user having their own virtual server.
    
    Using a VPS gives web administrators the administrative authority of a dedicated hosting arrangement, as well as the freedom to modify their server to their liking.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `I have a website. Can I transfer it to Hostinger?`,
    text: `Yes – if you're using a popular content management system like WordPress or Drupal, we offer solutions that make switching between web hosts simple and quick. Even if your website is not running a traditional CMS or if you only need a little assistance, our Customer Success team is here to walk you through the process.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `Can I buy hosting without a domain name?`,
    text: `You may buy domain names from other domain registrars and point them to your Hostinger server if you desire. Transferring an existing domain name to Hostinger is also possible if you want to maintain your domain name and website under one provider. Simply contact our Customer Success team – we will be happy to help!`,
  },
  {
    heading: `Do the plans come with a control panel?`,
    text: `Yes, you may control each plan from our in-house hPanel.

    It contains tools for basic administration, resource monitoring, email address creation, and installation of content management systems like WordPress. It's important to note that it is not the admin panel for your website, which is generated when you install a CMS.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `How can I upgrade my account if I need to?`,
    text: `With Hostinger as your website host, upgrading your plan is simple. Plan upgrades result in zero downtime, which means that your website will remain operational throughout. You won't have to worry about losing money or providing your visitors with an unpleasant browsing experience.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `Do I need web hosting with WordPress?`,
    text: `For a website built and managed with WordPress, you'll almost always require hosting. That's because WordPress is a content management system, not a platform designed to store website files and databases like Hostinger.

    With the correct platforms and a suitable plan, you can maximize your website's performance and content management demands.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `How to connect domain name with web hosting?`,
    text: `The easiest and most common way of connecting your domain name is by pointing it to Hostinger's nameservers. Like most things, domain pointing is easy to do through Hostinger’s admin panel.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `Do you offer a script auto-installer?`,
    text: `Yes, Hostinger provides a custom-built solution that allows you to install over 100 applications on your website with only one click. Our auto-installer not only saves time but also makes it faster and simpler to try out different scripts on your website and choose which ones are best for your needs.`,
  },
  {
    heading: `Do I need to have the technical knowledge to use Hostinger as my web host?`,
    text: `No, Hostinger makes it as simple as possible for beginners to learn the fundamentals as they go. Many actions, such as setting up an email account linked to your domain name or installing a content management system, may be completed in a matter of minutes with no prior technical experience.

    While it's simple to learn the basics and get started, our services are ideal for seasoned web developers. We believe our website hosting should be both user-friendly and robust.
    
    If you're having trouble, our Customer Success team will gladly assist you.`,
